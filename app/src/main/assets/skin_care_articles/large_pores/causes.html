    <p>The top five causes of large pores, include:</p>
    <li>OILY SKIN.
        <p>If you have naturally oily skin it’s likely you will have enlarged pores.
            This is because when excess oil, dead skin cells and dirt collect in your pores, your skin swells and your
            pores look larger than normal.</p>
    </li>
    <li>THE NATURAL AGING PROCESS
        <p>Aging causes your skin to lose its elasticity, which can make your pores look bigger.</p>
    </li>
    <li>YOUR GENDER
        <p>Biologically, men generally have larger pores than women.
            However, hormonal changes, like pregnancy, menstruation and puberty can increase the appearance of large
            pores in women.</p>
    </li>
    <li> SUN DAMAGE
       <p> Excessive sun exposure can make it seem you have big pores, by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Thickening your skin</li>
            <li>Reducing your skin’s collagen, elastin and water levels</li>
            <li>Shrinking the tissue beneath your skin, which stretches the edges of your pores</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>GENETICS
        <p>If you have large pores on your face, it’s likely that someone else in your family also has large pores.
            You might have also inherited thick or oily skin, which can cause your pores to appear large too.</p>
    </li>
