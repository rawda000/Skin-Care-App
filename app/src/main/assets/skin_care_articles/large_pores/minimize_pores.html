    <h2>How to minimize large pores</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Choosing water-based products
            <p>If a person has oily skin, they should ensure they use products that are water-based. Using water-based products avoids extra oil getting into the pores.</p>
            <p>A person with oily skin and large pores should avoid oil-based products. These may lead to excess oil on the skin, making pores appear larger.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Washing the face both morning and evening 
            <p>Washing the face is basic skin care. But with so many products available, a person may forget just to use warm water and a cleanser.</p>
            <p>Having a good face washing habit is essential. Washing the face every morning and evening helps to wash away oil and dirt from the pores, which helps to reduce their appearance.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
                Choosing gel-based cleansers
            <p>If a person has oily skin and wants to reduce the appearance of their pores, they should choose a gel-based cleanser.</p>
            <p>A moisturizing cleanser may leave residue in the pores and increase oiliness. A gel-based cleanser helps to clear oil from the pores, reducing their appearance.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Exfoliating
            <p>A person with oily skin should exfoliate once or twice a week. Exfoliating helps to remove things from the pores that can block them. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>dirt</li>
                <li>dead skin cells</li>
                <li>excess oil</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Look for exfoliating products containing salicylic acid, which is a natural acid that helps to release debris from the pores.</p>
            <p>Although exfoliation keeps the pores unclogged, they can look bigger if the skin becomes too dry.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            Moisturizing daily
            <p>The idea of moisturizing oily skin may be counterintuitive. However, it can help to reduce pore enlargement.</p>
            <p>Although moisturizing cleansers may clog the pores, in contrast, moisturizing lotions used after washing and patting the skin dry are beneficial.</p>
            <p>This is because moisturizers hydrate and soften the skin. This allows the sebum to penetrate deeper into the skin, rather than sit in the pores on the surface.</p>
            <p>In this way, moisturizing prevents pores becoming clogged with oil, reducing their appearance.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Applying a clay mask
            <p>Using a clay mask once or twice a week can help to remove oil from the pores. This can prevent them from becoming enlarged, and reduce their appearance.</p>
            <p>However, it is a good idea to do this on a different day to exfoliating. Over-treating the skin may cause irritation. When the skin gets irritated, pores may appear enlarged and blemishes may occur.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
            Always removing makeup at night
            <p>It is essential to always remove makeup before going to sleep.</p>
            <p>Sleeping with makeup on overnight can lead to a person's pores becoming blocked. This is because makeup, oil, and bacteria build up in the pores.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Wearing sunscreen
            <p>It is crucial to care for skin in the sun. If a person's skin becomes sun damaged, this can be very drying. When the skin is dry, pores may appear larger.</p>
            <p>Keeping the skin protected from the sun keeps it supple. The best ways to do this are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>wearing a wide-brimmed hat</li>
                <li>wearing sunscreen every day</li>
                <li>staying in the shade when the sun is strongest</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
