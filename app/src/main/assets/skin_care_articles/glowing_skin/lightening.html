    <h2>BEST NATURAL SKIN WHITENING HOME REMEDIES</h2>
    <p>
        Some people face problems on account of an uneven skin complexion while some are continually wishing to get
        fairer skin. It is almost a fad, with people wanting to alter their skin tones into lighter shades. There are
        numerous skin whitening creams in the market, widely marketed for their effects on the skin’s tone and texture.
        Most celebrities have, at least once in their lives, endorsed such creams. In reality, these creams are nothing
        more than a dip made from chemicals that bleach your skin and damage the outer layer of your dermis. It is best
        that you avoid such products, especially those claiming to give results overnight, for they might trigger
        side-effects such as acne breakouts, dullness, and an uneven skin tone. Some women regularly pay visits to
        parlours and spas to get and to maintain paler skin tones. Such maintenance, although effective to a certain
        extent, is also pretty expensive.
    </p>
    <p>A safe and affordable alternative for skin whitening is through the use of home remedies, using natural
        ingredients. Though these remedies only work to some extent to enhance your natural skin colour, they are still
        a much better choice than bleaching. They are mild on the skin and give you not exact but certainly incredible
        results, and they are extremely safe for your skin as well. Before starting a home remedy routine, it is
        important to understand the causes of skin darkening and how they can be prevented</p>

    <h2>Orange and Honey</h2>
    <p>
        While eating an orange is good for your health, making a paste from its peel is excellent for your skin. Make a
        paste using the peel of an orange and honey and apply it all over your face. It works best for oily and acne
        prone skin as honey has antibacterial properties that protect the skin while the orange peel has natural acids
        which help in combating skin pigmentation. It brightens your skin tone by several shades. It is also rich in
        vitamin C, which acts as a good depigmenting agent. It can even be used to treat blackheads, whiteheads, dead
        cells, acne and blemishes. Add milk or coconut oil to this mixture to get that extra glow.

    <h3>Papaya and oatmeal</h3>
    <p>
        Papaya is the ultimate skin-whitening agent. You can eat it regularly for a healthy gut. Or you could make a
        mask out of papaya and oatmeal to enrich your skin. Applying such a mixture gives you a lighter complexion and
        adds a glow to your skin. It also helps in reducing those nasty under eye circles. The oatmeal in the mixture
        acts as a gentle exfoliant while improving your skin’s health by efficiently removing dead cells from the top
        layers of your skin and unclogging the pores, thereby preventing the formation of acne as well. Ripe papaya pulp
        can also be mixed with grated apple, watermelon, pineapple and so on for added benefits while papaya and
        cucumber are an excellent combination for helping to remove a tan.

    <h2>Lemon</h2>
    <p>
        Water loss from the skin is more potent at night than during the day, so it’s best to rejuvenate, replenish and
        restore your body’s water levels in the evening. Lemon is a quick and effective solution to all your beauty
        woes. From its peel to its juice, everything in lemon has nutritional value. Being rich in Vitamin C,
        healthy-looking and fair skin is just one of the benefits that lemons have to offer. Its antibacterial and
        anti-fungal properties make lemon a natural treatment for reducing blackheads. Lemon juice works as an exfoliant
        and removes the dead skin cells, resulting in softer and smoother skin. You can either scrub the lemon peel or
        apply lemon juice on your skin to whiten it overnight, as a result of its ability to reduce the production of
        melanin.

    <h2>Yoghurt, gram flour and turmeric</h2>
    <p>
        You probably saw this one coming already. It’s a traditional and natural method, perhaps the most common one in
        Indian households, to whiten your complexion without the use of any chemicals. Turmeric has skin-whitening
        properties, provides essential nutrients to the skin and cleanses it, making your skin healthier and lighter
        after only a few applications. This is the reason that brides and grooms are literally coated in copious amounts
        turmeric paste before their wedding day. A mixture of yoghurt, gram flour and turmeric is everything your skin
        could have ever asked for. Yoghurt has probiotic bacteria which improves the texture of your skin while giving
        it a natural glow. It revitalizes and moisturizes the skin, reviving it in the process and giving it that fresh
        look. Gram flour, on the other hand, has antibacterial properties which helps it protect the skin from
        infections.

    <h2>Pumpkin and rice flour</h2>
    <p>Pumpkin is full of anti-oxidising agents and exfoliating acids. It consists of many vitamins, from A to C and
        beta-carotene, which help in lightening and brightening the skin. Rice flour lightens your complexion and also
        keeps blackheads at bay. It very efficiently removes the excess oils, leaving behind just enough to keep the
        skin moist. It also has anti-bacterial and anti-ageing properties. The coarseness of the rice flour helps remove
        all the dead skin cells and impurities that have accumulated on the skin. To increase the consistency of this
        mask, you may add a few drops of organic coconut oil to it. This will give you the added benefit of a supple,
        glowing skin
