    <h2>What does anti-aging really mean?</h2>

    <p>
        The definition of anti-aging is to delay, stop or retard the aging process. Our bodies are made of cells, and aging occurs when there is cell death. As an infant, child and young adult, our body’s cells are strong, resilient and can make new cells. As the years advance, our body’s ability to generate new cells diminishes, cell death occurs, and the aging process ensues.
