      Aging: it's something we all do but understand very little about. Sure, it's easy to make a list of all the changes that come with age — memory loss, wrinkles, muscle loss — but no one really understands what aging is, why it happens and how to stop it.
    </p>
    <h2>What Is Aging?</h2>
    <p>Think of aging as "that which happens to our bodies over time."
         This definition encompasses all of the aging the human body goes through,
          as opposed to the signs of aging that occur later in life, like gray hair and wrinkles.</p>
    <p>Some aging is caused by the body. Think kids growing and teenagers going through puberty.
         Other aging accumulates over time, like skin damage caused by sun exposure. As a result, aging is a combination of bodily changes and the impact of how we take care of ourselves.</p>
         <p>In other words, aging is the impact of time on the human body</p>
