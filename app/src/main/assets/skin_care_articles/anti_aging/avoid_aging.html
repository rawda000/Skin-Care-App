    <h2>Wrinkle prevention</h2>
    <p>While wrinkle treatments can improve the skin’s appearance, the best way to avoid wrinkles is to protect your skin from the sun. Limit the time you spend outside when it’s sunny out, wear protective clothing like a hat and long sleeves, and apply a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 when you’re outside.</p>
    <p>Lifestyle choices also affect your skin’s appearance. Apply moisturizer to your skin regularly to help keep it hydrated and looking it’s best. Avoid smoking, which can dry and wrinkle your skin. Stick to a healthy diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables and low in processed foods to reduce your risk of wrinkles.</p>
