    <h2>How Can Acne Be Prevented</h2>
    <p>To prevent acne and reduce its damage to your skin, follow these tips.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Choose a cleanser specially formulated for acne. These products often contain salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide, which help to clear acne sores.</li>
        <li>Clean your face gently, as trauma to the acne breakouts may worsen the acne or cause scarring. When washing your face, use your hands or cotton pads, as any terrycloth or other scrubbing material may cause acne sores to rupture.</li>
        <li>If you need to use a moisturizer, use only light, noncomedogenic moisturizers, which do not aggravate acne.</li>
        <li>If you are a woman, use an oil-free foundation. Heavy makeup or other cosmetic products that block pores may cause a flare-up of acne.</li>
    </ul>
