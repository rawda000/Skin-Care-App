    <h2>What Causes Acne?</h2>
    <p>Acne is primarily a hormonal condition driven by male or ‘androgenic’ hormones, which typically become active during the teenage years. Sensitivity to such hormones, combined with bacteria on the skin, and fatty acids within oil glands, cause acne. Common sites for acne are the face, chest, shoulders, and back -- the sites of oil glands.</p>
    <p>Acne lesions include whiteheads, blackheads, small bumps, and nodules and cysts.</p>
    <p>Though acne is essentially a normal physiologic occurrence, certain conditions may aggravate the condition, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fluctuating hormone levels around the time of menses (women)</li>
        <li>Manipulating (picking/prodding) acne lesions</li>
        <li>Clothing (for example, hats and sports helmets) and headgear</li>
    </ul>
