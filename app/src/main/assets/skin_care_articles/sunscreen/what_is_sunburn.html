        <h2>What Is Sunburn?</h2>
        <p>Sunburn is the term used to describe red and sometimes painful and swollen skin triggered
            by overexposure to the ultraviolet (UV) rays of the sun.
            Sunburns can be mild or severe.</p>
            <p>The extent of the damage caused may
             vary depending on the skin type and the amount of exposure to the sun.
            The risk of getting a sunburn increases as you near the equator.
            On a minute-by-minute basis, the highest risk of developing a sunburn is at solar noon, when the sun is right above you.</p>
