    <h2>What Causes Sunburn?</h2>
    <p>The sun emits UV rays of three wavelengths. They are:</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>UVA</li>
        <li>UVB</li>
        <li>UVC</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>While UVC rays do not reach the surface of the earth, the other two rays not
        only enter the surface of the earth but also penetrate your skin. This penetration
        of UVA and UVB rays can result in sunburn.</p>
    <p>
        Sunburn is one of the most obvious signs that
        you have been spending too much time in the sun.
        However, damage caused by exposure to the sun isnâ€™t always visible. Under the surface of your skin,
        the UV rays can alter your DNA, resulting in premature aging.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over time,
        the accumulation of damaged DNA can also contribute to
        life-threatening conditions like skin cancer.
