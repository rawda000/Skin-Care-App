    <h1>A natural boost for dry skin treatment</h1>

                Eat fish. At least twice a week, eat some oily, cold-water fish like herring or salmon. These are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which help keep your skin-cell membranes healthy. Other good sources of these fatty acids are walnuts, avocados, and flaxseed oil. Mix up to two tablespoons of flaxseed oil each day into your salad dressing or your morning oatmeal. (If you add it to hot cereal, do so only after the cereal is cooked. Flaxseed oil breaks down into less-useful compounds if you cook with it.)

                Take your vitamins. Certain vitamins and minerals help support healthy skin. Every day, take 100 milligrams of a B-complex vitamin supplement containing thiamin, riboflavin, and pantothenic acid; 15 milligrams of beta-carotene in divided doses, with meals; and 15 milligrams of zinc.

                Find the right formula. Look for products that offer an array of skin-enhancing nutrients in one pill. Look for a pill formula containing vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, riboflavin, vitamin B6, folate, zinc, selenium, and other minerals.
