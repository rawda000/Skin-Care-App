    <h2>Oily Skin Prevention</h2>
    <br><br>
    <p>
        Oily skin that is linked to genetics can be difficult to prevent. Even oily skin caused by changes in hormones is difficult to control.
    </p>
    <p>
        The best prevention for oily skin is for an individual to find a consistent skin care routine that works, and to stick to it.
    </p>
    <p>
        When oily skin arises, it can be tempting to hide it with makeup. However, certain products, particularly oil-based products, could make symptoms worse or clog the pores.
    </p>
    <p>
            Water-based makeup may be a better option for some, while others find wearing no makeup works best for their skin.
    </p>
    <p>
            Many people also say their diet is what keeps their skin from acting up. It may help to stay hydrated, avoid greasy foods and trans fats, and to eat a well-rounded diet full of whole foods.
