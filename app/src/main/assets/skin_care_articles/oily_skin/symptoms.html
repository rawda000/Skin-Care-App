    <h2>Oily Skin Symptoms</h2>
    <p>Oily skin frequently affects the face. Symptoms of oily skin include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a shiny or greasy appearance</li>
        <li>very large or obvious pores on the skin</li>
        <li>skin that looks thick or rough</li>
        <li>occasional or persistent pimples</li>
        <li>clogged pores and blackheads</li>
    </ul>
    <p>People with oily skin may have trouble finding makeup to suit their skin, as the makeup can mix with the sebum, giving it a different consistency.</p>
    <p>The symptoms of oily skin and their severity vary between people. Genetics may play a role in how oily the skin becomes.</p>
    <p>Hormone changes or high-stress levels may also increase the production of oily sebum by the body.</p>
